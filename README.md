# decide-together
Making a group decision, whether it's where to eat or what to do, is often unnecessarily difficult. 
This web browser app helps the group decision making process by having the individuals in the group give options and then by taking a poll on the given options.
Workflow:
1)	Make a private room with a question
2)	Give private room code to group
3)	Users input options
4)	Users up vote/down vote options
5)	Top x votes go to the poll
6)	Users rank each option
7)	Display results
